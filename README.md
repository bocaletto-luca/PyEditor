# PyEditor v1.0.0
#### Author: Bocaletto Luca

PyEditor is a modern, terminal-based text editor in Python that blends Nano’s simplicity with IDE-style features. It uses `curses` for fast screen updates, Pygments for real-time syntax highlighting, and a JSON config file for full customization of keybindings (save, quit, undo, redo, search, replace) and color themes. Core editing features include undo/redo stacks, incremental search (Ctrl+F), regex find & replace (Ctrl+R), dynamic line numbering, mouse-driven cursor placement, and a colorized status bar showing file name, modified flag, cursor position, and shortcut hints. It runs entirely in the console—ideal for SSH sessions, containers, or headless environments.

- Undo/Redo (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y)  
- Incremental search (Ctrl+F) and regex-powered find & replace (Ctrl+R)  
- Real-time syntax highlighting via Pygments  
- Dynamic line numbers and smooth scrolling  
- Mouse-click cursor positioning  
- Colorized status bar with modified-file indicator (*)  
- Fully customizable keybindings and theme via JSON  

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.6 or newer  
- Unix-style terminal with `curses` support  
- **Pygments** library  
  - Debian/Ubuntu:  
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-pygments
    ```  
  - Or in a virtual environment:  
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install pygments
    ```

## Installation

Clone the repository and prepare dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bocaletto-luca/PyEditor.git
cd PyEditor
```

Choose one of:

1. **System install of Pygments** (Debian/Ubuntu):  
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-pygments
   ```

2. **Virtual environment** (any Linux/macOS):  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install pygments
   ```

Finally make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x pyeditor.py
```
